**Master Deep Learning, and Break into AI**

Instructor: [Andrew Ng](http://www.andrewng.org/)

## Introduction

This repo contains all the programming assignments I have done regarding this specialization.
[Deep Learning Specialization on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning).

## Goals
- Learn the foundations of Deep Learning
- Understand how to build neural networks
- Learn about Convolutional networks, RNNs, LSTM, Adam, Dropout, BatchNorm, Xavier/He initialization etc.
- Practice all these ideas in plain Python using NumPy and in TensorFlow.
